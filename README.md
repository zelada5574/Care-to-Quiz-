# What was done with this challenge

We were given an assignment to create to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. It runs in browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS with JavaScript code. The front page should feature a time set to '0', a start button, and a hyperlink to go to the highscores page. Once the user has clicked the start button, the were given 75 seconds to answer as many questions correctly as possible. Every correct answer would be counted up and any missed answers will deduct 10 seconds of the timer. Whether right or wrong, the user would get text letting them know what they scored on the previous question. At the end of the alloted time, the user should be taken to a screen with their score and a line for inputting their initials. Once that is submitted, they are taken to the high scores screen with their score that can be cleared and a return to the start page button.
